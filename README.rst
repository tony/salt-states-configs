.. _v0.14.0: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/releases/0.14.0.html

Features
--------

* Support for dot-configurations
* Support for provisining minions

Why is the structure like this?
-------------------------------

based off https://github.com/python/pypi-salt.

``roots/`` is for anything that would be in ``file_roots`` or
``pillar_roots``.

Also, formulas are included (at a locked version / ref) in
``roots/formulas``. These must be added into ``file_roots`` individually.

- ./roots/pillar - pillar data
- ./roots/dot-configs - dot-config sls states
- ./roots/salt - package sls states
- ./roots/formulas - package sls from `saltstack-formulas`_ repository.

Dependency Formulae
-------------------

These are already part of this project as a submodule, but you may also
include them in your root as ``gitfs_remotes``.

For more information, see `Salt Formulas documentation`_.

Setup
-----

Clone the data recursively (include submodules):

.. code:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/tony/salt-states-configs.git /srv/salt/salt-states-tony

Add the necessary ``file_roots`` and ``pillar_roots`` to your project.

``/etc/salt/master``:

.. code:: yaml

    pillar_roots:
        base:
            - /srv/salt/salt-states-tony/roots/pillar

    file_roots:
        base:
            - /srv/salt/salt-states-tony/roots/salt
            - /srv/salt/salt-states-tony/roots/formulas/users
            - /srv/salt/salt-states-tony/roots/formulas/openssh
            - /srv/salt/salt-states-tony/roots/formulas/salt

Restart the salt master.

.. code:: bash

    $ [sudo] /etc/init.d/salt-master restart

Customize your pillar data in ``roots/pillar`` from the ``.example``
files.
